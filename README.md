# Linear/Non-Linear Regression_Modelling

## Introduction

This is a project which will help me build a solid understanding of fitting data to linear and non-linear regression models in python, while showcasing my familiarity with statistical tests and visualisation techniques. This is my first data project using biological test data, and it is one of my life goals to be able to develop novel therapeutics through the use of compute power and AI, so here I am working towards my goals. My previous project with Peregrine inlcuded credit card data to a logistic regression model, which classifies the variables into binary classes, and I would like to expand on this knowledge with linear and non-linear regression models.

My aim is to take a biological assay data set, fit it to a model and interpret the results, for example a drug response data set using tools like scikit-learn and Matplotlib.

## So what is Regression Modelling?

Regression Modelling is a kind of statistical analysis which allows the user to predict the future outcome of something based on the data available. The model is built to analyse the relationship between the independant variable(s) and the depenant variable. For example, in a clinical drug dose-response relationship, the independent variable (input) would be the dose of the drug, whereas the dependentant variable (output) would be the response to the drug.

### Linear and Non-Linear Regression 

Where the outcome will be continuous, for example predicting a person's weight based on their height.

### Logistic Regression

Where the outcome is divided into categories, for example if mail is classified as spam or not-spam (binary classifcation).
